# jReflect
A jQuery based framework simular to AngularJs in many ways.
# Why would you need it
Revamping old projects might be somehow difficult, specially with all the tables used back then, so in order to change it all, you need to repeat the same data in a responsive Html template of your choice, and it's where it gets tricky, specially that in most cases it would be difficult to change the framework to a newer one, that's why it would be easier to use a jQuery based framework for Templating.
